		<h1>2 versions of luma on 1 sd</h1>
		<p>This is good for having both the features of <br /> the newest Luma and the ability to use NTR CFW <br /> What you'll need: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Computer (Doesn't matter what OS you have)</li>
			<li>3ds with B9S</li>
			<li>SD card (You don't need that much free space)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Let's start now!</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Download the 2 releases you want from <a href="https://github.com/AuroraWright/Luma3DS/releases" target="_blank"> Github </a></li>
			<li>Copy the one you want to boot by default to root of SD (replacing any files)</li>
			<li>Copy the other one to sdmc:/luma/payloads</li>
			<li>Eject SD card and put into 3ds</li>
		</ol>
		<p>If you did all that, then you can boot into another version <br /> of Luma by holding START on boot and choosing the file named "boot".  </p>
