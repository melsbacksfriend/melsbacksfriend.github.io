		<h1>Safer alternative to eMMC upgrade</h1>
		<p>I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR BANS OR SD CORRUPTIONS!  <br />What you'll need: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Unix based OS (Again, using Ubuntu)</li>
			<li>Hackable Switch</li>
			<li>Python</li>
			<li> <a href="https://gist.github.com/ckurtz22/5748f3f761e0a546675f2720a1e5e486" target="_blank"> resize-user.py </a> </li>
			<li>Hekate</li>
			<li>SD with capacity >=64GB</li>
			<li>(if using Ubuntu) Gparted</li>
			<li>CFW (You can use any cfw except ReiNX, even Hekate but I use atmosphère)</li>
			<li>python-mbedtls</li>
			<li>Lockpick RCM</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Let's go! (Like Pokémon Let's Go Eevee, My favorite Switch game)</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Go into Hekate</li>
			<li>Back up both raw GPP and BOOT0/BOOT1</li>
			<li>Back up keys using Lockpick RCM</li>
			<li>Put SD into computer</li>
			<li>Open Terminal</li>
			<li>Execute this command without quotes and replacing PATH TO BOOT0, PATH TO BOOT1 and PATH TO RAWNAND.BIN with the paths to those files "cat PATH TO BOOT0 PATH TO BOOT1 PATH TO RAWNAND.BIN > emummc.bin"</li>
			<li>Execute this command without quotes "sudo python3 pip install --user python-mbedtls"</li>
			<li>Execute this command without quotes and replacing PATH TO RESIZE-USER.PY, PATH TO EMUMMC.BIN and PATH TO PROD.KEYS with the paths to those files and replacing SIZE with partition size in GB "python3 PATH TO RESIZE-USER.PY PATH TO EMUMMC.BIN SIZE PATH TO PROD.KEYS"</li>
			<li>Open Gparted</li>
			<li>Select your SD card</li>
			<li>Right click on the only partition there and select "Resize/Move"</li>
			<li>Make the unallocated space after be the size you want (MUST BE >=THE FILE SIZE OF EMUMMC.BIN!)</li>
			<li>Right click on the unallocated space and create a partition that fills the unallocated space (Format doesn't matter)</li>
			<li>Apply the operations</li>
			<li>Open the terminal again</li>
			<li>Execute without quotes and replacing /dev/sdxy with the location of the new partition and PATH TO EMUMMC.BIN with the path to that file "sudo dd if=PATH TO EMUMMC.BIN of=/dev/sdxy"</li>
			<li>Eject your SD card and put it into your Switch</li>
			<li>Go back into Hekate</li>
			<li>Choose emummc</li>
			<li>Select SD RAW partition 1</li>
			<li>Boot into your favorite CFW (not ReiNX)</li>
		</ol>
		<p>That was a LOT of steps but now you're done!  </p>
