		<h1>Have big file on fat32</h1>
		<p>What you'll need: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Unix based OS on your computer (I'm using Ubuntu)</li>
			<li>Hackable Switch</li>
			<li>fat32 sd card</li>
			<li>Some way to boot Switch into CFW</li>
			<li>NXshell (available on HB app store)</li>
		</ul>
		<p> Without further ado, let's get started!  </p>
		<ol>
			<li>Get the file you want</li>
			<li>Open the terminal</li>
			<li>Execute this command without quotes and replacing PATH TO FILE with the path to the file you're using "split -d -a 1 -b 4294901760 PATH TO FILE 0"</li>
			<li>Create a folder on your sd card.  THE FOLDER'S NAME SHOULD END WITH THE EXTENSION OF THE FILE YOU STARTED WITH (example: I start with ssbu.nsp and name the folder ssbu_split.nsp)</li>
			<li>Copy all of the files that appeared after splitting the original file into the folder you created</li>
			<li>Eject sd card and put into Switch</li>
			<li>Boot Switch into CFW using whatever method you prefer</li>
			<li>Go into hbmenu and choose NXshell</li>
			<li>Enable developer mode in NXshell's settings</li>
			<li>Select folder and choose "Set archive bit".</li>
		</ol>
		<p> Now your Switch should treat the folder as a file made up of the folder's contents merged.  </p>
